        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        <p>
          This project has been such an incredible experience, and we are so
          honored and appreciative to have been on this journey with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that everyone is eager to hear what the next steps for
          ConstitutionDAO are, and weâ€™ve been deeply exploring several options
          for this over the last four days. While we would very much like to
          have been able to do so, we have determined that building and
          maintaining an ongoing project is not something that we as a core team
          are able to support, given the technical and administrative
          requirements of doing it properly.
        </p>

        <p>Given this, we believe this project has run its course.</p>
        <p>
          The community has taken all actions that it was organized to accomplish:
          we raised capital, we bid at Sothebyâ€™s, and upon losing, we made full
          refunds available to the community as promised. <strong>At this time we want
          to encourage anyone who has been waiting to claim their refund to do
          so. There is no time limit on claiming these refunds.</strong> The Discord will
          be left open for 14 days for discussion, and then will shift to
          read-only.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was a landmark event that showed the entire world that a
          group of internet friends can use the power of web3 to face a
          seemingly insurmountable goal and achieve incredible results on an
          impossible timeline. It is our sincere hope that this project will
          spark many others that take inspiration from the enthusiasm and
          accomplishments of everyone involved to use the power of web3 to make
          a positive impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love you all, and are truly humbled to have been part of history
          together.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely, The ConstitutionDAO Team</p>
