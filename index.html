    <h2>so what's going on?</h2>
    <div>
      We’re buying the US Constitution.<br/><br/>
      For the first time in thirty-three years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sothebys-auction-rare-first-printing-us-constitution-2021-09-17/">one of eleven surviving copies of the Official Edition from the Constitutional Convention will be publicly auctioned by Sotheby's.<a/> It is the only copy that is still owned by private collectors. The proceeds from the auction will be given to a charity that has been established by the current owner.
      <br/><br/>
      <b></b>ConstitutionDAO is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAO</a></b> that is pooling together money to win this auction. We intend to put The Constitution in the hands of The People.
    </div>

    <h2>Why is it a DAO?</h2>
    In short: so the people own it. Together.
    <br/><br/>
    Decentralization and cryptocurrency (web3) has created structures that allow people to self-govern and fractionalize ownership with unparalleled levels of autonomy and freedom. It’s fitting that we use this technology to honor and protect the greatest historical tool for human governance: The US Constitution.
  
    <h2>What is your plan?</h2>

    Immediately, to preserve and protect the Constitution. We intend to find a safe home for it, such as the Smithsonian.
    <br/><br/>
    The ConstitutionDAO will govern future decisions around destination, preservation, as well as plans for purchasing other historical artifacts.

    <h2>Why The Constitution?</h2>

    We believe that The US Constitution is a <i>shared good </i>and should be shared and displayed in public spaces — by the people whose governance and freedom it was created to protect. By purchasing it with a DAO, we fractionalize ownership, distribute the responsibility among many, and provide the infrastructure to keep the Constitution preserved.

    <h2>What Am I Buying?</h2>
    Fractional ownership and governance. You will own a piece of the Constitution based on how much you contribute, as well as the ability to vote for what direction future efforts (such as fractionalization, display, and other purchases) take.
