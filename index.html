            >ConstitutionDAO (2021-2021) was a beautiful experiment in a
            single-purpose DAO.</strong
          >
          We now believe this project has run its course.
        </p>

        <p>
          The community has taken all actions that it was organized to
          accomplish: we raised capital, we bid at Sothebyâ€™s, and upon losing,
          we made full refunds available to the community as promised.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having lost the auction and following the core team's
          choice to wind down, we would like to remind you that the tokens possess no rights,
          governance, or utility other than redeeming them for ethereum from the smart contract
          held in Juicebox at a ratio of 1,000,000:1â€”the same ratio at which contributions
          were made to the initial crowdfund to buy the Constitution.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also an option to keep your $PEOPLE tokens and do with them as you pleaseâ€”it is
          clear that there are parts of the community who wish to incorporate them into future
          projects. <strong>ConstitutionDAO cannot and will not endorse any future plans for the token.
          Nothing in here is financial advice. Do your own research.</strong>
        </p>
